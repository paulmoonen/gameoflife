# Game of Life

A traditional math pastime.
Simple rules can produce amazing patterns in time and pace...

This program opens up a window with an empty, clickale area, and several buttons below.

The cells in a ( 30 x 30 ) grid can be either 'alive' (black) or 'dead' (white).
Click a spot in the clickable area, to toggle the status of the cell right there, 
and to make all kinds of patterns and clusters of 'alive' cells.

This is the first generation of 'alive' cells.
A simple set of rules, using the statuses of the neighbouring cells, determines whether a specific cell will come alive, will stay alive, or will die, in the next generation. 

buttons:

Next Generation:    show the next generation, which descends from the current pattern
Clear:              all cells 'dead'
Invert:             make all 'dead' cells 'alive', and all 'alive' cells 'dead'
Chessboard:         show the grid by making an alternating chessboard like pattern of 'alive' cells
Random:             fill with a random pattern of 'alive' and 'dead' cells
